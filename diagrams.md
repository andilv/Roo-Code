## Diagrams

This section provides textual representations of key diagrams to illustrate the architecture and data flow within Roo Code.

**1. Component Diagram**

This diagram shows the major components of the Roo Code system and their primary relationships.

Relationships:
- `<-->`: Bidirectional communication or strong interaction.
- `-->` : Unidirectional communication or dependency.
- `^ / v`: Indicate primary flow or control.

**Key Components in Diagram:**

*   **VS Code Editor:** The host environment providing UI elements, APIs (for files, terminal, editor actions), and the extension lifecycle.
*   **Roo Code Extension (Host):** The main extension process running in VS Code.
    *   Manages activation, command registration.
    *   Interfaces with VS Code APIs.
    *   Hosts the Webview UI.
    *   Contains the core task orchestration logic.
*   **Webview UI (Cline Panel):** The primary user interface for chat, task initiation, and viewing results. Runs in a separate webview process.
*   **Task Orchestration (`core/task/Task.ts`):** The central brain that manages a single AI task, including history, AI communication, tool calls, and state.
*   **External AI Providers:** Third-party LLM services (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) that the extension communicates with via their APIs.
*   **Editor Services:** Modules interacting with VS Code's editor features (e.g., showing diffs, managing text decorations).
*   **Workspace Services:** Modules for interacting with the user's workspace (reading/writing files, searching, respecting `.rooignore`).
*   **Browser/Web Services:** Modules for automating browser actions or fetching content from URLs.
*   **MCP Hub/Services:** Manages communication with external tools via the Model Context Protocol.

**2. Call or Data Flow Diagram: User Initiates a Task and AI Responds (Simplified)**

This diagram illustrates the sequence of events and data flow when a user types a message/task and the AI responds.

```
1. [User Input (Webview UI)]
   "Write a Python function to calculate factorial"
    |
    v
2. [Webview Message Handler (`core/webview/webviewMessageHandler.ts`)]
   (Receives message from UI)
    |
    v
3. [ClineProvider (`core/webview/ClineProvider.ts`)]
   (Relays message to extension host, potentially creating/finding a Task)
    |
    v
4. [Task Object (`core/task/Task.ts`)]
   - Receives user message.
   - Updates internal conversation history (Cline messages).
   - Prepares API request (adds system prompt, environment details, user message).
   - Updates UI: "API Request Started" (via ClineProvider).
    |
    v
5. [API Handler (`src/api/index.ts` & specific provider like `src/api/providers/openai.ts`)]
   - Formats request for the specific LLM provider.
   - Sends request to the LLM API.
    |
    v
6. [External LLM API (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic)]
   (Processes request and generates a response)
    |
    v
7. [API Handler (`src/api/index.ts`)]
   - Receives raw response from LLM.
   - Parses/transforms response (handles streaming if applicable).
   - Extracts text, tool calls, token usage.
    |
    v
8. [Task Object (`core/task/Task.ts`)]
   - Receives processed AI response.
   - Updates API conversation history.
   - Parses assistant message (e.g., using `parseAssistantMessage`).
   - Presents assistant message (e.g., using `presentAssistantMessage`):
     - If text response: Displays text in UI (via ClineProvider).
     - If tool request:
       - Displays thinking/tool usage in UI.
       - Asks user for approval (if needed).
       - Invokes the appropriate tool function (e.g., `readFileTool`).
       - (Tool execution and result processing would be subsequent steps, potentially looping back to step 4/5 with tool results).
    |
    v
9. [ClineProvider (`core/webview/ClineProvider.ts`)]
   (Receives updates from Task Object)
    |
    v
10. [Webview UI (Cline Panel)]
    (Displays AI's textual response, reasoning, or tool usage information to the user)

```

This flow is simplified and focuses on the initial interaction. If the AI requests a tool, the flow would continue with tool execution, sending results back to the AI, and further AI responses, creating a loop until the task is complete or the user intervenes. Context condensing and other background processes also interact with the `Task` object.
```
