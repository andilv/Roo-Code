## Known Limitations or TODOs

This section outlines identified limitations, areas for future improvement, and general considerations for the Roo Code project.

**Codebase Observations:**

*   **No Explicit TODOs/FIXMEs:** Initial scans of the `src` directory using `grep` for "TODO" and "FIXME" comments did not yield any results. This suggests a relatively clean codebase in terms of explicitly marked pending tasks or known issues within comments. However, this does not preclude the existence of areas needing improvement or refactoring that are not explicitly tagged.
*   **Complexity of `src/core/task/Task.ts`**:
    *   The file `src/core/task/Task.ts` has been identified as a significantly large and complex module (over 1800 lines of code).
    *   It handles a wide range of responsibilities, including task lifecycle management, API communication, webview interaction, tool invocation, state management (pausing, resuming), and checkpointing.
    *   **Potential TODO/Refactoring Area:** Due to its size and multifaceted role, `Task.ts` represents a piece of technical debt. Future refactoring efforts could focus on breaking down this class into smaller, more specialized modules to improve maintainability, testability, and overall code clarity. For example, aspects like API message handling, Cline message handling, or specific task state transitions could potentially be encapsulated in separate classes or modules.

**General Considerations (from README.md and nature of the project):**

*   **AI Output Reliability (Inherent Limitation):**
    *   The README.md includes a standard disclaimer stating that "Roo Code, Inc does not make any representations or warranties regarding any code, models, or other tools... You assume all risks associated with the use of any such tools or outputs."
    *   This is an inherent limitation of any AI-powered coding tool. The generated code, suggestions, and actions taken by the AI agent may contain inaccuracies, errors, defects, or biases.
    *   Users are responsible for reviewing and validating all outputs and actions performed by Roo Code.
*   **Context Management:**
    *   While Roo Code 3.19 introduced "Intelligent Context Condensing," managing the context window effectively for large projects or long conversations remains a complex challenge for all LLM-based agents. There might be ongoing efforts or future needs to further refine context handling strategies.
*   **Tool Capabilities and Safety:**
    *   The ability to execute terminal commands and automate browser actions is powerful but also carries risks if not managed carefully. While there are settings like `roo-cline.allowedCommands`, ensuring robust safety and security around these tools is an ongoing concern for autonomous agents.
*   **Evolving AI Models:** The capabilities and limitations of Roo Code are tied to the underlying AI models it uses. As these models evolve, the extension may need updates to adapt to new APIs, token limits, or output formats.

**Future Work (Implied):**

*   **Continuous Improvement of AI Agent Behavior:** Enhancing the reasoning, planning, and tool-use capabilities of the AI agent is likely an ongoing effort.
*   **Expansion of Tools and Integrations:** The Model Context Protocol (MCP) suggests a framework for adding more tools. Expanding the set of available tools and integrations could be a future direction.
*   **User Experience Refinements:** As with any software, ongoing improvements to the user interface and overall user experience are expected.

While no explicit "TODO" comments were found, the complexity of certain core modules like `Task.ts` and the inherent challenges of AI-driven development suggest that there will always be areas for refactoring, enhancement, and careful consideration of limitations.
