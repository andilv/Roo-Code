## Project Overview

Roo Code (formerly Roo Cline) is an AI-powered autonomous coding agent designed to operate within a developer's editor, primarily VS Code. It aims to enhance software development efficiency by assisting with a variety of coding tasks.

**Core Capabilities:**

*   **Natural Language Interaction:** Roo Code can understand and respond to instructions given in natural language.
*   **Workspace Interaction:** It has the ability to read and write files directly within the user's workspace.
*   **Command Execution:** The agent can run terminal commands.
*   **Browser Automation:** Roo Code is capable of automating actions in a web browser.
*   **API Integration:** It supports integration with any OpenAI-compatible API or custom AI models.
*   **Customizable Modes:** Users can define "Custom Modes" to tailor Roo Code's personality and capabilities for specific roles, such as a QA engineer, system architect, or product manager. This allows for specialized assistance depending on the task at hand.

**Key Features:**

*   **Code Generation:** Generates code from natural language descriptions.
*   **Refactoring and Debugging:** Assists in refactoring existing code and debugging issues.
*   **Documentation:** Can write and update documentation.
*   **Q&A:** Answers questions about the codebase.
*   **Task Automation:** Automates repetitive coding tasks.
*   **File and Project Creation:** Capable of creating new files and projects.
*   **Smart Tools:** Roo Code utilizes a set of tools for file operations, terminal execution, browser control, and extensibility via the Model Context Protocol (MCP). MCP allows users to add custom tools and integrate with external APIs or databases.
*   **Customization:** Offers various customization options, including custom instructions, custom modes, support for local models, and auto-approval settings for actions.

**Technology Stack (based on gathered information):**

*   **Language:** TypeScript
*   **Framework:** VS Code Extension
*   **Testing:** Likely Jest (presence of `jest.config.mjs` and `__tests__` directories)
*   **Formatting:** Likely Prettier (presence of `.prettierignore`)

**Development and Community:**

*   The project is actively developed, with a `CHANGELOG.md` tracking updates.
*   It has a community presence on Discord and Reddit.
*   Contributions are welcome, with guidelines provided in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
*   The project uses `pnpm` for package management and `changesets` for versioning and publishing.

Overall, Roo Code positions itself as a versatile and extensible AI coding assistant integrated directly into the development environment. The codebase appears to be well-maintained, with no immediate signs of legacy TODOs or FIXMEs in the `src` directory. The project structure is typical of a VS Code extension, utilizing TypeScript and common development tools.
