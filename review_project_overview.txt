The "Project Overview" section in `codebase_analysis.md` was reviewed against the main `README.md`.

Findings:
No significant discrepancies or missing key information were found. The "Project Overview" accurately summarizes the purpose, core capabilities, key features, technology stack, and development aspects of the Roo Code project as described in the `README.md` and supplemented by information gathered during prior codebase analysis.

Minor differences exist but are appropriate given the different purposes of the two documents (user-facing README vs. technical analysis):
- The overview correctly omits specific version release details, quick start links, and the full legal disclaimer found in the README, as these are not central to a technical overview of the codebase itself. The essence of the disclaimer (risks of AI tools) is captured in the "Known Limitations" section.
- The overview accurately reflects the project's former name.

The "Project Overview" is well-aligned with the source README.md and provides a solid foundation for the codebase analysis document. No changes are strictly necessary for this section based on the comparison.
